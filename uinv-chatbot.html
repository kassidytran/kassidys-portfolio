            <h2>Overview</h1>
            <p>In March of 2023, our team of four UX/UI design students were tasked with redesigning the Unemployment Insurance of Nevada (UINV) website. Our team designed an AI chat bot to replace the primary navigation of the UINV website and assist users in navigating the site as well as provide user support. This project spanned 6 weeks, starting off with a one week design sprint and ending with a presentation of a high-fidelity, responsive prototype. </p>

            <h2>Starting off with a design sprint</h2>
            <p>To kickstart our design process, we started off with a one-week design sprint. In order to gain insight into the user’s perspective, we jumped straight into a UI assessment of the <a href="https://ui.nv.gov/css.html">Nevada Unemployment Insurance Claim Filing System (UINV) website</a>, taking note of these major usability issues:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Overwhelming amount of links and texts lead to cognitive overload</li>
                <li>Little hierarchal distinction between content makes the site difficult to navigate</li>
                <li>Text is small and colors are a harsh contrast to the background, decreasing legibility</li>
                <li>Dull colors that present an unwelcoming and cold user experience </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="cs-img-container">
                <figure>
                    <img src="media/uinv-chatbot/uinv-home.png">
                    <figcaption>Current user interface for the UINV website</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>
            <p>To ensure our assessment of the problems we found were not biased, we interviewed two users that had previously experienced unemployment and have filed for unemployment to conduct a usability test of the website. Both users interviewed stated that when they were stressed and filing for unemployment, their immediate wish was to talk to someone to help them complete the unemployment insurance claim process.  </p>
            <p>This user feedback inspired our design goals. We aimed to improve the navigation of the website and create a more welcoming atmosphere to recently unemployed users, who are already dealing with high amounts of stress. We then drafted a user persona and problem statement to represent our target user demographic. </p>
            <p class="callout">“I am a former warehouse manufacturing business employee. I am trying to apply for unemployment benefits for some stability and the ability to financially support my family, while looking for a new job, but I’m not sure what unemployment benefits I am eligible for. I’m dreading applying because I’m expecting the application process to be long and confusing, because I have never had to apply for unemployment before, which makes me feel overwhelmed!”</p>

                </figure>
            </div>
            <p>While conducting usability testing with a low-fidelity prototype, we asked users how they might interact with the chatbot to file a claim. Results revealed that users were able to effectively use the chat bot to complete their task, and some users noted that a chat bot was more effective in navigating the website and seeking help if they needed assistance after call center hours or if phone lines were busy. </p>

            <h2>Creating a chatbot conversation flow</h2>
            <p>We now needed to address the issue of restructuring the primary and secondary navigation on the website. A content inventory and audit was conducted and we realized we needed to address a few major issues:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Clarify process to file a claim</li>
                <li>Rename document titles with user-friendly language</li>
                <li>Content and typographic hierarchy to emphasize important content</li>
                <li>Website should include a reliable form of navigation</li>
            </ul>
            <p>With these assumptions, we dove into user research and interviews, asking five social media users about their behavioral habits when traveling and using social media apps, as well as their attitudes towards our concept.</p>

            </ul>
            <p>Based on the results of our design sprint, we asked ourselves: </p> 
            <p class="callout">“Since research showed that users immediately want someone to talk to, and need help with navigating the enemployment claim process, what if we designed our chat bot to do both?”</p> 
            <p>Thus, we began to explore the idea of the chat bot acting as the main form of navigation. A competitive analysis of chat bots on other websites revealed that chat bots can act as both customer service and a quick form of navigation. </p>
            <p>Taking data from our content inventory, we listed out multiple questions that users might ask when using the website, then categorized them by topic. We then input information found on the UINV website into ChatGPT and trained the AI to provide informationally accurate answers to potential user questions. These different conversation sequences were visualized in a chat bot flow. </p>

            <h2>Building a mockup using design principles</h2>
            <p>After exploring the layouts of different chat bots on different websites, we started creating our first drafts of the layout of our chat bot’s design. In order to streamline the design process, we created a pattern library of icons and components in Figma to use when building our chat bot design. </p>
            <p>The chat bot content was enclosed within a common border to demonstrate to users that these chat elements are grouped together. For this design, we also ensured that the corners of the window and buttons were rounded to soften the design and communicate friendliness and ease of use. We decided on a large pop-up modal for our chat bot for ease of use and accessibility for users unfamiliar with using chatbots. Our team also considered that since the visual content on the website is already overwhelming and confusing to navigate, having a larger pop-up obscure the disorganized interface would simplfy the user experience for anxious users. </p>
            <p>We wanted to ensure our chat bot was viewable on both desktop and mobile devices, so we used grids to design a mobile version of the chat window. A 12 column grid was applied on desktop, while a 4 column grid was applied on the mobile frames.  </p>

        <section class="cs-section-a">
            <h2>User testing to find the right voice for our chat bot</h2>
            <p>Because our goal was to provide anxious users with a human-like voice to talk to when in need of help, we focused on testing the tone of our chat bot replies. </p>
            <p>An A/B test was conducted, comparing a ChatGPT response in a friendly-tone vs. a professional tone. Based on our user research insights, we hypothesized that users would prefer a friendly, easygoing response compared to a more professional response. </p>
            <div class="cs-img-container">
                <figure>
                    <img src="media/uinv-chatbot/ab-test.png">
                    <figcaption>A/B testing comparing two different tones of voice, a  friendly tone and a professional tone. Responses for five dfferent questions were tested for user preference. </figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>
            <p>Contrary to expectations, users were split between their preferences. Users who preferred the friendlier tone stated that the friendly response was less intimidating and easier to digest due to the shorter responses. However, other users stated that the friendly tone seemed disingenuous, too cheerful, and contained too much “customer service fluff”. On the other hand, users who preferred the professional tone stated that this was more expected for a government website, and liked that more detailed information was provided. </p>
            <p>After reviewing these insights, we decided to compromise: a professional tone will be used for our chat bot’s voice, while our UI will communicate a friendly atmosphere. The lengthy professional messages will be broken up into separate message bubbles to become more easily digestible. </p>

        <section class="cs-section-b">
            <h2>Creating a high-fidelity prototype and applying style</h2>
            <p>Our team created a style guide and depicted our chat bot as a bluebird from Carson, inspired by Nevada’s state bird and capital city. Carson was animated to appear as if he is eager to answer any questions the user might have, catching the user’s attention and presenting the chat bot as approachable and friendly. The blue and yellow color palette communicates trustworthiness and an eagerness to help to the user. </p>

                </figure>
            </div>
            <p>Due to time constraints, we decided to focus on developing one of the two responsive designs into a complete prototype. Secondary user research revealed that the average person in Nevada filing for unemployment: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Have obtained less than a high school education</li>
                <li>Identifies as a member of the Black or Native American communities</li>
                <li>People with disabilities between the ages of 20-64</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Due to these insights, we concluded that a mobile device is more accessible than a desktop computer for these users, as it is more cost effective and easier to use, therefore we focused on developing a high-fidelity prototype for presentation. </p>

            <h2>Learning opportunities</h2>
            <p>This case study provided an excellent opportunity to practice visual design, and how to ensure each design choice is a conscious decision. Visual design can evoke certain emotions within the user, which affects the overall user experience of using the website or app. </p>
            <p>Additionally, this was the first time I was able to practice using AI in the design process. I believe that AI tools like ChatGPT are beneficial in streamlining the design process, and am looking forward to exploring other AI tools for design projects in the future. </p>
