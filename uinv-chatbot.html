            <h2>Overview</h1>
            <p>In March of 2023, my team of four UX/UI design students were tasked with redesigning the Unemployment Insurance of Nevada (UINV) website. We designed an AI chat bot to replace the primary navigation of the UINV website and assist users in navigating the site as well as provide user support. This project spanned 6 weeks, starting off with a one week design sprint and ending with a presentation of a high-fidelity, responsive prototype. </p>

            <h2>Starting off with a design sprint</h2>
            <p>My team and I started off with a one-week design sprint. We each conducted a cognitive walkthrough of the <a href="https://ui.nv.gov/css.html">Nevada Unemployment Insurance Claim Filing System (UINV) website</a>, taking note of these major usability issues:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span style="font-weight:500">Risk of cognitive overload</span> for users due to overwhelming amount of links and texts</li>
                <li><span style="font-weight:500">Little hierarchal distinction</span> between content makes the site difficult to navigate</li>
                <li><span style="font-weight:500">Poor legibility</span> due to small text size and harsh contasting colors</li>
                <li><span style="font-weight:500">Unwelcoming user experience</span> due to cold color palette</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="cs-img-container">
                <figure>
                    <img src="media/uinv-chatbot/uinv-home.png">
                    <figcaption>Current user interface for the UINV website</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>
            <p>To avoid bias in our assessnments, we also observed two users who have previously filed for unemployment interact with the website. Both users mentioned <span style="font-weight:500">feeling stressed</span> during unemployment and <span style="font-weight:500">wanting to talk to someone</span> who can help. </p>
            <p>Based on user feedback, our design goals were defined as such: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Simplify the navigation of the website</li>
                <li>Create a more welcoming atmosphere for users</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A user persona was quickly created to prepare our team for brainstorming solutions - we needed a concrete description of a user who needed these problems to be solved. Then, our problem statement was generated, inspired by our user persona. </p>
            <div class="cs-img-container">
                <figure>
                    <img src="media/uinv-chatbot/user-persona.png">

                </figure>
            </div>
            <p class="callout">“I am a former warehouse manufacturing business employee. I am trying to apply for unemployment benefits for some stability and the ability to financially support my family, while looking for a new job, but I’m not sure what unemployment benefits I am eligible for. I’m dreading applying because I’m expecting the application process to be long and confusing, because I have never had to apply for unemployment before, which makes me feel overwhelmed!”</p>
            <p>Our proposed solution to this problem was to design a chatbot, which provides users with a welcoming personality to chat and find general assistance. We then came up with a storyboard to get an idea of the user flow and interactions with the chatbot.</p>
            <div class="cs-img-container">

                </figure>
            </div>
            <p>While conducting usability testing with a low-fidelity prototype, we asked users how they might interact with the chatbot to file a claim. Insights from our testing revealed that users: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Found the chatbot more efficient in navigating the website</li>
                <li>Wished the chatbot had more of a personality</li>
                <li>Wanted to use the chatbot to speak to a human customer service representative</li>
                <li>Preferred to use the chatbot if phone lines for the call center were busy</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="cs-section-b">
            <h2>Creating a chatbot conversation flow</h2>
            <p>The results of our design sprint revealed the chatbot as favorable among users. Based on the insights from user testing, we built upon this idea: </p>
            <p class="callout">What if we designed our chatbot to be a friendly persona to talk to and help users navigate the unemployment claim process?</p>
            <p>Our chatbot would act as the primary method of navigation on the website. In order to achieve this while maintaining a welcoming personality, we decided to design the chatbot with artificial intelligence (AI) in mind. An AI-chatbot could provide information to the user in a more natural and personable manner. </p>
            <p>My team conducted a content audit of the current information on the website and I categorized the content by topic, and brainstormed potential questions or statements that users might input when using the chatbot. I entered information found on the website into ChatGPT to ensure the AI would provide accurate information in responses. Finally, I compiled both the user inputs and appropriate responses into various conversation sequences, so the team could visualize how the user might interact with our chatbot in conversation. </p>

        <section class="cs-section-a">
            <h2>Finding the right voice for our chatbot</h2>
            <p>I knew that personality and delivery of information was crucial for the success of our chatbot in alleviating stress in anxious users. User attitudes towards the chatbot could differ based on the language and tone of voice used. In order to find the right voice for our chatbot, I had ChatGPT generate two responses differing by tone.</p>
            <p class="callout">Would users prefer responses in a <span style="font-weight:500">friendly</span> tone or a <span style="font-weight:500">professional</span> tone?</p>
            <p>Based on our user research insights, we hypothesized that users would prefer a friendly, easygoing response compared to a more professional, serious response. </p>
            <div class="cs-img-container">
                <figure>

                    <figcaption>Five user inputs followed by two different versions of responses, one with a friendly tone and one with a professional tone. The friendly response uses simpler language, more encouraging phrases and exclamation marks, while the professional response provides more detailed information with serious language.</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>
            <p>Results differed from our expectations: users were split between their preferences, so we needed to compromise.</p>

                    <h3>Friendly Tone</h3>
                    <h4>Pros</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Less intimidating</li>
                        <li>Easier to digest due to shorter responses</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Cons</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sounds disingenuous, fake </li>
                        <li>Customer service fluff</li>
                        <li>Unreliable, vague information</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Professional Tone</h3>
                    <h4>Pros</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Appears more reliable</li>
                        <li>Expected of a government website</li>
                        <li>More detailed information</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Cons</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Visually overwhelming due to longer responses</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Based on these gathered insights, we proposed a compromise: our chatbot will use a professional tone of voice, and the long responses will be visually broke up into more easily digestible chunks of text using message bubbles. The user interface will also communicate a friendly atmosphere. </p>

            <p>We wanted our chatbot to be approachable, so we chose a bluebird (Nevada’s state bird), who we named Carson (after the state capital), to visually represent a friendly persona. By using a non-human persona for our chatbot, we wanted the user to feel like they are still receiving the assistance they need without needing to feel judged for their circumstances by another person. The blue and yellow color palette communicates Carson’s trustworthiness and eagerness to help, and the rounded corners softens the design and allows Carson to appear friendlier. </p>

            <p>Unlike other chatbot designs, we chose to enclose our chatbot in a large popup window. This was decided upon for a variety of reasons: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The <span style="font-weight:500">chatbot will also act as a navigation system</span> for the website</li>
                <li><span style="font-weight:500">No products or important information is displayed on the home page</span>, so it is unlikely users will need to view the home page and use the chatbot simultaneously</li>
                <li>We can <span style="font-weight:500">improve legibility and interaction expereince</span> for users if we maximize the available space for the chat window</li>

            <h2>Creating an interactive prototype</h2>
            <p>Because of our limited time constraints, we decided to focus on developing one of the two responsive designs into a complete prototype. Secondary user research revealed that the average person in Nevada filing for unemployment are: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Have obtained less than a high school education</li>
                <li>Identifies as a member of the Black or Native American communities</li>
                <li>People with disabilities between the ages of 20-64</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Due to these insights, we concluded that a mobile device is more accessible than a desktop computer for these users, as it is more cost effective and easier to use, therefore we focused on developing a high-fidelity prototype for presentation. </p>

            <p>This case study provided an excellent opportunity to practice visual design, and how to ensure each design choice is a conscious decision. Visual design can evoke certain emotions within the user, which affects the overall user experience of using the website or app. </p>
            <p>Additionally, this was the first time I was able to practice using AI in the design process. I believe that AI tools like ChatGPT are beneficial in streamlining the design process, and am looking forward to exploring other AI tools for design projects in the future. </p>
